# Calculator-for-big-numbers
(Implementation of Data Structures And Algorithm)
Calculator for very big numbers using doubly linked list 
--> if we want to add or multiply 2 small numbers then we can easily calculate it using simple calculator
but what if you want to do something like that,

9876592379849658937948793457254086724058762085602384567287465923457082835923786502365487236572630562 * 723647627364189364712649871647614761724361764378146781963491376419346 = ?

for this type of work we have to use this implementation.

-> for doing this i have make 3 doubly liked list first 2 are for input and third one is for output. 
-> take input in form of string and with the use of doubly linked list, follow traditional calculation for doing calculation.
